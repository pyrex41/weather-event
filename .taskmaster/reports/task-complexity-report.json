			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Rust + Axum + Elm with Vite project structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into subtasks: one for initializing the Cargo workspace and adding Rust dependencies, one for setting up the Elm frontend with Vite and plugins, and one for configuring the build process and verifying integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up a multi-language project with Rust, Elm, and Vite, requiring familiarity with multiple build tools and dependency management. Implementation effort includes creating workspaces, adding numerous dependencies, and configuring hot-reload, which is moderately complex due to potential integration issues. Technical challenges include ensuring compatibility between versions and tools. Testing requires verifying builds and servers, adding to effort. Dependencies are minimal, but the task lays the foundation for others."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design and implement SQLite database schema with sqlx migrations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: one for defining Rust structs and enums, one for creating SQL migration files, and one for implementing type-safe queries with sqlx.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a normalized schema with multiple tables, enums, and foreign keys requires careful planning to avoid data integrity issues. Implementation effort is medium-high due to defining structs, migrations, and compile-time queries. Technical challenges include handling JSON serialization for complex fields and ensuring type safety. Testing involves migrations, unit tests for serialization, and integration tests for queries and concurrency, increasing complexity."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into: one for defining the WeatherClient struct and methods, one for implementing JSON parsing and unit conversions, one for adding error handling and retries, and one for writing tests including property-based tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires building an API client with async calls, parsing external JSON, performing precise unit conversions, and robust error handling. Implementation effort is high due to multiple data transformations and retry logic. Technical challenges include accurate conversions (e.g., meters to miles) and detecting conditions like thunderstorms. Testing with mocks, property-based tests, and integration adds significant requirements."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement weather conflict detection with training level safety logic",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks: one for implementing the safety checking function with pattern matching, and one for loading and caching minimums from the database.",
			"reasoning": "Involves business logic with pattern matching on enums and database interactions for configurable rules. Implementation effort is medium, focusing on logic correctness. Technical challenges include ensuring rules are hierarchical and caching works efficiently. Testing with unit and property-based tests for edge cases is straightforward but necessary."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate OpenAI API for structured AI rescheduling suggestions",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to subtasks: one for defining structs and building prompts, one for implementing API calls with structured output, one for adding caching and fallback logic, and one for testing with mocks.",
			"reasoning": "Requires integrating with an AI API, handling JSON responses, implementing caching for performance, and fallback logic. Implementation effort is high due to prompt engineering and error handling. Technical challenges include ensuring valid JSON output and caching TTL. Testing involves mocking API responses and verifying parsing, adding complexity."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into: one for setting up the broadcast channel and Axum handler, one for implementing the WebSocket connection handling with heartbeats, and one for defining notification types and broadcasting.",
			"reasoning": "Involves real-time communication with WebSockets and broadcast channels for pub/sub. Implementation effort is medium-high, with concurrency aspects. Technical challenges include handling disconnections, heartbeats, and backpressure. Testing requires integration tests with clients and multiple connections."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Elm frontend with Vite and WebSocket ports integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: one for setting up Elm project structure and types, one for implementing HTTP API calls, one for integrating WebSocket ports, one for building the dashboard UI, and one for testing with E2E tools.",
			"reasoning": "Building a full SPA in Elm with ports for WebSockets and HTTP integration is complex, requiring Elm knowledge and UI design. Implementation effort is high due to multiple modules and real-time updates. Technical challenges include port communication and styling. Testing includes unit tests and E2E with Playwright."
