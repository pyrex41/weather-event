			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance WebSocket Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks covering Elm frontend WebSocket module extensions (connection states, reconnection logic, message queuing), Rust backend handler updates (ping/pong heartbeats, disconnection detection, client management), integration testing, and E2E testing for resilience.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to cross-language implementation (Elm and Rust), async handling with tokio, exponential backoff algorithms, and comprehensive testing across unit, integration, and E2E levels."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Connection Status Indicator",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this is a straightforward UI component with reactive updates.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on Elm UI updates and model tracking, with dependency on Task 1, but primarily visual and event-driven without heavy logic."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Comprehensive Error Handling System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for Elm error handling module (message mapping, UI display, auto-dismiss) and Rust backend error standardization (middleware, rate limiting, retry logic).",
			"reasoning": "Involves both frontend and backend, with middleware integration (Redis for rate limiting) and consistent error formats, requiring careful coordination and testing."

			"taskTitle": "Add Loading States and User Feedback Components",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this is UI-focused with optimistic updates and spinners.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate effort in Elm for integrating feedback across async operations, dependent on error handling, but straightforward UI patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Form Validation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for Elm client-side validation (real-time feedback, field errors) and Rust server-side validation (using crates, business logic checks).",
			"reasoning": "Requires dual-side implementation with real-time UX, regex validations, and integration with error handling, plus comprehensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Weather Alert Banner and Display Logic",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this is a single Elm component with WebSocket integration.",
			"reasoning": "Focused on Elm UI component with state management and WebSocket events, moderate due to persistence and dismissal logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Backend Weather Monitoring Service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for weather data fetching and analysis logic, and alert generation/broadcasting with database integration.",
			"reasoning": "Async service with external API integration (OpenWeatherMap), data analysis, and broadcasting, dependent on alert display, with testing challenges."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Reschedule Modal UI with Options Display",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this is a UI modal component in Elm.",
			"reasoning": "Elm UI implementation with defined types and loading states, dependent on error and loading components, but not highly complex."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate OpenAI API for AI-Powered Suggestions",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for API service implementation (prompt construction, response parsing) and caching/error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Involves external API integration with parsing, caching for cost management, and graceful error handling, with testing via mocks."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Backend Reschedule API and Business Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,

			"reasoning": "Endpoint development with business logic validation, database operations, and notifications, requiring atomicity and integration with existing logic."
